Wold’s solution use latent variable approach, extract small number latent variables predictors use predict responses. method later named Partial Least Squares (PLS). initial algorithm called “NILES” (Nonlinear Iterative Least Squares), later renamed “NIPALS” (Nonlinear Iterative Partial Least Squares). Coming background econometrics, cleanly independent predictors rare, Wold stranger challenges introduced multicollinearity. 1966, laid groundwork become PLS introducing iterative least squares method estimate principal components [11]. 1969, colleagues applied methods econometric problems including canonical correlation analysis fixed-point estimation [15]. PLS emerged extension PCA. reduce dimensionality preserving structure, PLS goes maximizing covariance predictors responses—making effective regression tool. Herman Wold; father PLS [10] 1975, Wold colleagues released formal description PLS algorithm applications increasingly large predictor spaces [13]. laid foundation -called “Basic Design” PLS late 1970s [14], provided formal treatment algorithm convergence. 1980s, PLS gained traction chemometrics, particularly spectroscopy chromatography. iterative NIPALS algorithm well-suited handling large variable sets missing data [16]. Software packages helped adoption, though theoretical work briefly stalled. changed 1990s resurgence PLS development, aided modern computing power. key moment came Sijmen de Jong’s 1993 publication SVD-based approach PLS [3], computed components instead iteratively. dramatically improved efficiency opened PLS large-scale applications genomics, proteomics, metabolomics [7]. Modern variants like sparse PLS kernel PLS emerged address high-dimensional nonlinear problems. rise R Python ecosystems, community-driven implementations made PLS accessible ever [8].  2000s, PLS found application neuroimaging (e.g., fMRI analysis [5]) later machine learning data mining kernel-based extensions [9]. toolkits matured, became staple classification, regression, feature extraction. Recent work integrates PLS Bayesian models, ensemble methods, even deep learning. example, Deep PLS methods combine interpretability powerful representation learning [6]. continued expansion, PLS remains one flexible powerful tools multivariate statistical analysis.","code":""},{"path":"https://jesusbutforgaypeople.github.io/snazzieR/articles/pls-overview.html","id":"references","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"Overview of Partial Least Squares (PLS) Regression","what":"References","title":"PLS Overview","text":"Abdi, H.
